# Range number generator
This code represents the generateListNumbers function that generates a list of numbers within a specified range based on input data such as the first number, last number, maximum number of values in the list, and excluded numbers. The function validates input data and outputs an error message in case of incorrect input. It also has a functionality for copying the results to the clipboard and uses the getWordEnding function to determine the correct form of the word for quantitative numerals.
